# MeetupApp-next.js-demo

Meetup project is created with next.js

Purpose of the project is using and understanding next.js features.

I experienced Server side rendering with both ServerSideprops and staticprops.

Codes are written by me but the project does not belong to me.

This is Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's project which is created for learning purposes.
